2024-09-17T11:20:05 - Germany - Intel causes German government to rupture after shelving €30bn plant | Fortune Europe - Germany's finance minister has urged his government to reallocate the €10 billion it had set aside for the Intel plant.Intel has confirmed it will shelve plans to construct a mammoth €30 billion chip factory in Germany, sending its struggling government into a panic over the billions of euros it has committed to the project.
Reports swirled earlier this month that Intel was considering shelving or even abandoning plans for its €30 billion German plant. The postponement will offer some relief to Chancellor Olaf Scholz as Germany’s manufacturing sector sits mired in a two-and-a-half-year-long recession.
While Intel says the giant factory in Magdeburg will go ahead eventually, it has caused members of Germany’s coalition government to break rank as panic stews about the long-term prospects of its massive industrial sector.
In response to Intel’s announcement, Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, who is aligned with a different party from Chancellor Scholz, has called for the funds to be redistributed to plug an urgent gap in Germany’s finances.
